```

The `agents` array can include any built-in agent IDs plus runtime IDs provided by installed extensions. Each agent keeps its own `skillsDir`, installed skills list, and MCP preferences. Runtimes that support custom agent files also persist `agentsDir` and `installedAgentFiles`, so `ai-factory update` can refresh package-managed agent files alongside skills. Codex additionally persists `configFiles` / `installedConfigFiles` for managed files such as `.codex/config.toml`; tracked managed config files may be repaired by `ai-factory update` when their managed hashes drift, while untracked pre-existing files are preserved during migration. Codex app is currently skills-first: it installs Codex-style skills into `.agents/skills` and can write MCP config to `.codex/config.toml`, but it does not define a runtime-global `agentsDir`. AI Factory additionally stores internal `managedSkills`, `managedAgentFiles`, `managedConfigFiles`, and `agentFileSources` maps in `.ai-factory.json`; they are omitted from the example above for brevity. `managedAgentFiles` keeps source/install hashes, while `agentFileSources` records whether each tracked agent file comes from the bundled package inventory or from an extension manifest. `loadConfig()` still reads legacy Claude-only `subagentsDir`, `installedSubagents`, and `managedSubagents` keys for backward compatibility, but new saves use the universal field names and backfill `agentFileSources` when the source can be recovered from bundled inventory or installed extension manifests.

Extension-provided agent files can target non-Claude runtimes such as Codex. Those files are often bounded helper workers (for example, one-shot reviewers or plan polishers), not automatic equivalents of the bundled Claude coordinator agents. Documentation and prompts should describe those support boundaries explicitly instead of implying full parity across runtimes. AI Factory copies those runtime-specific agent files verbatim; runtime-local keys such as `model`, `model_reasoning_effort`, `sandbox_mode`, and `developer_instructions` belong in the agent file itself rather than in `.ai-factory.json` or workflow prompts. For bounded Codex helpers, prefer read-only advisory workers unless the runtime-native agent truly owns writes to a specific artifact.

Agent-file lifecycle is now consistent across the CLI:
- `extension add` installs the file, records `installedAgentFiles`, records `agentFileSources`, and writes fresh `managedAgentFiles` hashes immediately.
- `ai-factory update` preserves tracked extension-owned agent files even when an extension manifest is temporarily missing, warns, and skips only the source-driven drift healing that cannot be resolved safely.
- `extension remove` deletes the runtime-local file and prunes `installedAgentFiles`, `agentFileSources`, and `managedAgentFiles` together.

The optional `extensions` array tracks installed extensions by name, original source, and version. `ai-factory update` now refreshes these extensions from their saved sources before base-skill updates, and `ai-factory extension update [name] --force` refreshes them without running the full base-skill update flow.

Extension refresh uses the saved `source` field:

- npm sources are checked against the npm registry and skipped when the published version is unchanged
- GitHub sources fetch `extension.json` through the GitHub API before cloning
- local paths and non-GitHub git sources require `--force` for refresh

When GitHub-backed extension refreshes are frequent, set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to raise the GitHub API rate limit used by these checks.

## `.ai-factory/config.yaml` — User Preferences

User-editable configuration file for language, paths, workflow settings, and rules hierarchy. Created by `/aif` during project setup.

For the complete key-by-key schema plus the built-in skill read/write matrix, see [Config Reference](config-reference.md).

**Two-file architecture:**
- `.ai-factory.json` — CLI state (agents, installed skills, MCP config) — managed by ai-factory package
- `config.yaml` — User preferences (language, paths, workflow) — edited by developers

`/aif` creates the initial `config.yaml` from `skills/aif/references/config-template.yaml`, so the commented template structure is preserved instead of being rewritten as a minimal YAML blob.

On setup reruns, `/aif` updates only the managed key subset it owns (`language.*`, `paths.*`, `workflow.*`, selected `git.*`, and `rules.base`). Existing comments, manual customizations outside the targeted keys, unknown sections, and `rules.<area>` registrations are preserved.

Those comments are intentional: they are part of the human-editable experience for `config.yaml`, not disposable formatting noise.

**Current config-aware skills** read `config.yaml` at Step 0. This currently includes:
- Core workflow and quality commands: `/aif`, `/aif-plan`, `/aif-implement`, `/aif-verify`, `/aif-commit`, `/aif-review`, `/aif-rules-check`, `/aif-roadmap`, `/aif-explore`, `/aif-loop`, `/aif-rules`, `/aif-warmup`
- Additional utility commands: `/aif-architecture`, `/aif-docs`, `/aif-fix`, `/aif-improve`, `/aif-evolve`, `/aif-transfer`, `/aif-reference`, `/aif-distillation`, `/aif-security-checklist`, `/aif-qa`, `/aif-qa-check`, `/aif-archive`

Other skills are config-agnostic for now and rely on repository context, explicit arguments, or fixed non-configurable paths such as `skill-context`.

Current config-agnostic built-ins include `/aif-best-practices`, `/aif-build-automation`, `/aif-ci`, `/aif-dockerize`, `/aif-grounded`, and `/aif-skill-generator`.

**Language semantics:**
- `language.ui` controls prompts, questions, progress updates, summaries, and next-step guidance.
- `language.artifacts` controls generated or persisted artifacts, including plans, fix plans, patches, rules, references, security ignore state, documentation, QA outputs, and `/aif-explore` research snapshots in `paths.research`.
- Explicit `/aif-explore ultra` uses the same language policy and derives named bundles at `<parent(paths.research)>/research/<english-topic-slug>/`; no additional path key is needed.
- `language.technical_terms` controls whether human-readable terminology is kept, translated, or mixed while commands, paths, identifiers, branch names, config keys, package names, API names, machine-readable metadata keys and enum values, and raw errors stay unchanged where required.

**Git workflow semantics:**
- `git.enabled: false` disables branch/worktree assumptions entirely.
  `/aif-plan full` still writes `paths.plans/<slug>.md`; `/aif-plan ultra`
  writes `paths.plans/<slug>/index.md` plus phase files.
- `git.base_branch` is the branch used for diff, review, verify, rules-check, and merge guidance. Skills must not hardcode `main`.
- `git.create_branches: false` keeps git awareness enabled but disables
  automatic branch creation for both full and ultra plans.
- `git.skip_push_after_commit: true` makes `/aif-commit` stop after local commit without showing push prompt.
- Ultra is strictly opt-in through `/aif-plan ultra`; no new config key is
  required, and existing fast/full prompts and artifact shapes remain unchanged.
- `paths.plan` remains the default fast-plan file. If you prefer fast plans inside `paths.plans/`, change `paths.plan` manually in `config.yaml`.
- `paths.docs` controls where `/aif-docs` writes the detailed documentation pages. `README.md` remains the landing page in the project root.
- `warmup.paths` is an ordered list of extra files or directories for `/aif-warmup`. Entries resolve from and must stay inside project root; directories are scanned recursively for readable text files. Missing config is equivalent to an empty list.
- `paths.qa` controls where `/aif-qa` and `/aif-qa-check` store QA artifacts. A derived branch slug is appended automatically: `<paths.qa>/<branch-slug>/change-summary.md`, `test-plan.md`, `test-cases.md`, and `qa-check.md`. Agent-mode `/aif-qa-check` also uses root-level `<paths.qa>/agent-context.md` and `<paths.qa>/agent-history.md` to reuse non-sensitive cross-QA setup facts and recurring learnings, including stable browser routes/selectors and safe command/test-filter patterns. Run-specific details such as branch names, QA target paths, summary counts, assertion totals, and one-off command transcripts stay in `<paths.qa>/<branch-slug>/qa-check.md`. The slug is a deterministic, filesystem-safe, stable derived value with mandatory 40-character safe-slug truncation and a short hash suffix for collision resistance — see `skills/aif-qa/SKILL.md` for the full algorithm. `/aif-qa-check` binds results to the tested commit plus working tree digest, or to a manual build identifier when git is unavailable, plus deterministic `test-cases.md` and per-case digests.

**Current schema limits:** `config.yaml` still leaves `.ai-factory/skill-context/` fixed by command contract. `README.md` and `docs-html/` remain fixed by current documentation workflow.

### Rules Hierarchy

AI Factory supports a three-level rules hierarchy:

1. **paths.rules_file** — Axioms (universal project rules)
   - Short, flat list of hard requirements
   - Managed by `/aif-rules`

2. **rules/base.md** — Project-specific base conventions
   - Naming conventions, module boundaries, error handling
   - Created by `/aif` from codebase analysis

3. **rules.<area>** — Area-specific rule file paths in `config.yaml`
   - Examples: `api`, `frontend`, `backend`, `database`
   - Created by `/aif-rules area:<name>`

Each area is a named config key whose value is the rule file path. Example: `rules.api: .ai-factory/rules/api.md`.

**Priority:** More specific rules win. `rules.api` > `rules/base.md` > `paths.rules_file`

## MCP Configuration

AI Factory can configure these MCP servers:

| MCP Server | Use Case | Env Variable |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| GitHub | PRs, issues, repo operations | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Postgres | Database queries | `DATABASE_URL` |
| Filesystem | Advanced file operations | - |
| Chrome Devtools | Browser inspection, debugging, performance | - |
| Playwright | Browser automation, web testing | - |

Configuration saved to agent's settings file (e.g. `.mcp.json` for Claude Code and Universal / Other, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor, `.vscode/mcp.json` for GitHub Copilot, `.roo/mcp.json` for Roo Code, `.kilocode/mcp.json` for Kilo Code, `opencode.json` for OpenCode, `.codex/config.toml` for Codex app).

### Runtime Format Contract

Source of truth for runtime MCP shapes and wrapper examples:
[`skills/aif/SKILL.md#MCP Configuration`](../skills/aif/SKILL.md#mcp-configuration)

Quick key mapping:
- Standard MCP runtimes use `mcpServers.<server>`
- OpenCode uses `mcp.<server>`
- GitHub Copilot uses `servers.<server>`
- Codex app uses TOML tables under `mcp_servers.<server>`

### Environment Variables

MCP configs use `${VAR}` placeholders for credentials. OpenCode stores credentials under `environment`, GitHub Copilot receives `${env:VAR}` in `.vscode/mcp.json`, and Codex app receives credential names in `env_vars` inside `.codex/config.toml`. Set them before launching the agent:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db"
```

Runtime-specific wrapper examples are intentionally centralized in the `/aif` skill section above to avoid docs drift.

## Project Structure

After initialization (example for Claude Code — other agents use their own directory). Paths shown below are the default locations; many AI Factory artifacts can be relocated via `config.yaml`.

## Reflex Loop Files

`/aif-loop` keeps state lean and resumable between sessions. Defaults are shown below; the base loop directory can be relocated via `paths.evolution`.

- `.ai-factory/evolution/current.json` — active loop pointer (to current run)
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/run.json` — current run snapshot (loop execution state)
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/history.jsonl` — append-only event history
- `.ai-factory/evolution/<task-alias>/artifact.md` — latest artifact output

For full phase contracts and stop conditions, see [Reflex Loop](loop.md).

## Evolution Cursor File

`/aif-evolve` uses a lightweight cursor to process patches incrementally. Defaults are shown below; patch and evolution-log directories can be relocated via `paths.patches` and `paths.evolutions`.

- `.ai-factory/evolutions/patch-cursor.json` — last processed patch marker
- First run (no cursor): evolve reads all patches
- Subsequent runs: evolve reads patches newer than the cursor (plus a small overlap window to catch missed points)
- To force a full rescan: delete `patch-cursor.json` and run `/aif-evolve` again

`/aif-transfer` reuses the current project's `paths.evolutions` for an approved delegated
evolve log, but it does not copy source patches into `paths.patches` and never reads or
advances the current patch cursor for transferred evidence.

## Best Practices

### Artifact Ownership and Context Gates
- Keep context artifact ownership command-scoped (roadmap by `/aif-roadmap`, rules by `/aif-rules`, architecture by `/aif-architecture`, research by `/aif-explore`).
- Treat `/aif-rules-check`, `/aif-commit`, `/aif-review`, and `/aif-verify` as read-only consumers of context artifacts by default.
- Use `WARN` for non-blocking gate findings (missing optional files, ambiguous mapping) and `ERROR` for blocking violations.
- Parseable quality gates append a final `aif-gate-result` JSON block with lowercase `pass` / `warn` / `fail` status values; see [Quality Gates](quality-gates.md).

### Logging
All implementations include verbose, configurable logging:
- Use log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Control via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Implement rotation for file-based logs

### Commits
- Commit checkpoints every 3-5 tasks for large features
- Follow conventional commits format
- Meaningful messages, not just "update code"

### Testing
- Always asked before creating plan
- If "no tests" - no test tasks created
- Never sneaks in test code
